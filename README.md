# customer-Analytics-using-SQL
A data-driven SQL project simulating an e-commerce platform to uncover key customer behavior metrics—like churn, retention, and lifetime value—using advanced querying techniques and KPI frameworks.

# Project Overview: 
A self-initiated data analytics project that simulates an e-commerce order system and uses SQL to derive actionable customer insights. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and churn patterns using a structured relational schema. The dataset simulates an e-commerce platform’s data.

# Objective : To understand key patterns in customer behavior—such as churn, repeat purchases, product return tendencies, and customer value—using advanced SQL queries and visual analytics. The project aims to identify actionable insights that can guide customer engagement, product improvement, and retention strategies.
